      Homemade pizza turns simple ingredients into a delicious meal. The dough,
      made from flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil, is topped with tomato
      sauce and your favorite toppings. Baking at a high temperature results in
      a crisp, golden crust and perfectly melted toppings.

    <p>
      Making pizza at home is easy and customizable. You can create anything
      from a classic Margherita to a unique combination of toppings, resulting
      in a fresh, tasty pizza that's better than store-bought.
